  "The half of `kotoba.abi.wit-data-test` that never needed a JVM.

  That file is `.clj` for one honest reason -- `embedded-wit-matches-the-file`
  compares each embedded string against the file it came from, through
  `clojure.java.io`, and the check needs the side that can still see the
  original. `run-tests.cljs` says as much, and calls it `the one genuinely
  JVM-bound assertion in this repository's tests`. Singular, and correct.

  Everything around that assertion was JVM-bound only by living beside it, and
  one of the deftests is worse than incidental: it exists BECAUSE
  `world-wit-v2` used to throw `typed capability WIT source is JVM-only` for
  any effectful consumer under ClojureScript, and it had only ever run on the
  JVM. A test written to prove a ClojureScript path works, executed on the
  other host.

  Nothing here reads a file. The embedded bytes are the subject, which is the
  whole point of embedding them."
